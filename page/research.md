{% epigraph 'Only something that has no history is definable.' '' %}

So wrote Nietzsche in *On the Genealogy of Morality* (1887), turning the historicist lens of the modern age upon idea itself. My own fascination with intellectual history begins here, with the premise that the worldviews and the concepts we use are never static. What was once solid melts into air, and what was once sacred is profaned. It is only through history that we can guard ourselves against parochialism and fanaticism.

My research focuses on the "long 19th century", a period that has been defined in different ways by scholars like Hobsbawm and Osterhammel. In the field of intellectual history, Koselleck's concept of the *Sattelzeit*{% sidenote 'IT1' 'saddle period, “鞍型期”' %} is pivotal. It illuminates an era of intense conceptual change at the dawn of modernity. In the mid-1700s, people across the globe—not just in Europe—still lived with the expectation of repeating the lives of their ancestors. By the turn of the 20th century, however, no one could confidently map the path ahead. As capitalism spread across the world, new ideas were created, adapted, and circulated globally, forging the very assumptions that seem self-evident to us today.

The task, therefore, is to develop an "archaeology" of ideas. This approach does not assume a fixed path of progress, nor does it hold to a single narrative of development. Rather, it attends to things themselves, examining the unique context of a thinker, a text, or a movement to grasp "the past's past" and "the futures past." In this sense, we can return to and rethink the assertion: all history is the history of thought.

German "Bonapartistes" during the Napoleonic era

Currently, I am preparing my doctoral dissertation, which examines the fate and ideas of German "Bonapartists" during the Napoleonic era, under the joint supervision of [Prof. Armin Owzar](https://www.sorbonne-nouvelle.fr/m-owzar-armin-231917.kjsp) (Sorbonne Nouvelle) and [Prof. Iwan-Michelangelo D’Aprile](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/kulturen-der-aufklaerung/personal/prof-dr-iwan-michelangelo-daprile) (University of Potsdam). Drawing on archives, manuscripts, and printed documents, this dissertation aims to reconstruct the contexts, actions, and intellectual trajectories of German intellectuals who supported Napoleon during the period of French hegemony.

**Who are/were the "Bonapartists"?** In the context of today's political science, the term is often used as a synonym for partisans of "Caesarism": a form of centralized and authoritarian power derived from popular will. However, in Napoleon's era, "Bonapartist" was not a neutral descriptor but a pejorative and polemical concept, first employed around 1814 as a rhetorical weapon to discredit political adversaries. My dissertation therefore begins by analyzing the term not as a pre-defined category, but as a polemical tool whose targets and meaning must be historically reconstructed by examining the nationalist propaganda that created it.

This approach reveals that the primary targets of these attacks were not the high-ranking nobles who collaborated with the French, but rather a specific group of middle-class intellectuals. The common thread connecting these figures—such as Karl Ludwig von Woltmann (1770-1817), Friedrich Buchholz (1768-1843), and August F. W. Crome (1753-1833)—was their role as influential publicists.{% marginnote 'BO1' 'As noted by Heinrich Luden (1778–1847), they often emphasize terms such as "*Geist der Zeit, Fortschreiten mit dem Zeitgeiste, Cultur, liberale Ideen, Civilisation, Organisiren, Toleranz, Humanität*"; in opposition to "*veraltet, Altfränkisch, Feudalität, Bigotismus, Anarchie, Finsterniß des Mittelalters*".' %} As authors, professors, and editors of influential journals (*Zeitschriften*), they were deeply engaged in shaping public opinion and writing the history of their own present (*Zeitgeschichte*), making them key players in the public sphere that nationalists sought to dominate.

However, this group of accused "Bonapartists" was far from monolithic, and my research demonstrates the wide divergence in their motivations, objectives, and intellectual trajectories. Their support for the Napoleonic system ranged from preserving a form of the Empire to pursuing state sovereignty and modernizing reforms within the Confederation of the Rhine. Furthermore, their allegiances were often fluid, with many moving through phases of admiration and eventual disillusionment. By focusing on these publicists, my project provides a nuanced intellectual history that moves beyond the nationalist dichotomy of "patriot" versus "traitor", seeking to understand them as complex thinkers grappling with the ambivalent figure of Napoleon and the profound transformations of their time.

Wilhelm von Humboldt and the German Liberalism
---
{% fullwidth 'assets/img/research/Wilhelm von Humboldt.jpg' "Gottlieb Schick, <em>Wilhelm von Humboldt in Rom</em> (1808/1809)" %}

For the last several years, another major research project of mine has involved an investigation into the intellectual evolution of the Prussian linguist and statesman Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835), focusing on his relationship with the German Enlightenment (*Aufklärung*), classical philosophy, and the French Revolution. My work has centered specifically on the genesis and intellectual context of his liberal treatise, _The Limits of State Action_ (written in the early 1790s, published posthumously 1852), connecting its composition to his earlier intellectual journey. I explored this process in detail in my master's thesis, supervised by [Prof. Li Hongtu](https://icscc-transfers.ens.fr/article19.html) (Fudan University).

Building upon my master's thesis, I have continued this research in two directions. The first concerns the relationship between Humboldt's early political thought and the concept of "happiness" (*Glückseligkeit*) in the German Enlightenment. This research has resulted in a [published article](https://www.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&dbname=CJFDLAST2025&filename=LSJX202502003&uniplatform=OVERSEA&v=7NP0OAC2TObMQh4Jfv23mMjAIzPnP68XxMDO5u30mHkZBM2_e4S1BzIUgVZGlqhm){% sidenote 'HU1' '"Wilhelm von Humboldt and the Concept of Happiness in the Age of Enlightenment." *History Research and Teaching*, no. 2 (2025): 20-32.<br><br>《威廉·冯·洪堡与德意志启蒙时代的幸福概念》，《历史教学问题》，2025年第2期，第20至32页。' %}, the abstract of which is as follows:

> In studies on Wilhelm von Humboldt, the concept of happiness and its historical context are seldom addressed, despite their pivotal role in shaping his early ideas. During the German Enlightenment, philosophers extolled a rationalistic understanding of "happiness," viewing it as a state of enduring joy that could be objectively attained and even promoted through state intervention. Initially, Humboldt adhered to this perspective. Influenced by Sentimentalism and critiques of Enlightenment views on happiness from thinkers such as Jacobi and Kant, he gradually came to emphasize "sensibility" in his concept of "happiness." In July 1788, the Prussian "Religious Edict" was issued, prompting Humboldt to write *On Religion*. In this work, he articulated a unique concept of happiness, defining it as the growth of individual capacities rather than simply a state of enduring joy. This idea carried over into his work *The Limits of State Action*, forming the cornerstone of Humboldt's liberal theory of the state, which later influenced the development of 19th-century liberal political thought.

The second direction of my research investigates Humboldt's interactions and connections with the French Revolution. This article is currently a work in progress.
