I"&<p>Born and raised in Shenzhen, I have pursued my studies in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Paris, fostering a keen interest in observing the world. I committed to history as my vocation during my undergraduate studies and, driven by a personal inclination, minored in philosophy and chose intellectual history as my field of research.</p>

<p>With the encouragement of the mentors and friends I have met, I continue to advance on this academic path. In addition to my native Chinese, I am fluent in English, French, and German, and have a working knowledge of Latin. Outside of academia, I enjoy classical music, Souls-like games, reading and writing. <label for="qrcode" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="qrcode" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/qrcode.jpg" /><br /></span></p>

<p>— Yes, I also keep a personal blog on WeChat (“张书吏”), where I write in Chinese about current events as well as reflections on historiography. Feel free to follow if you’re interested.</p>
