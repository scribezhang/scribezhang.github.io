Welcome! I am Baihao Zhang (张柏豪), a PhD candidate in Modern History and German Studies at Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris. {% marginfigure 'profile' 'assets/img/profile.jpg' '👤 Baihao Zhang, 张柏豪<br>✉️ baihao.zhang@sorbonne-nouvelle.fr' %} My doctoral research, supported by a scholarship from the China Scholarship Council (CSC), is now conducted under the joint supervision of [Prof. Armin Owzar](https://www.sorbonne-nouvelle.fr/m-owzar-armin-231917.kjsp) (Sorbonne Nouvelle) and [Prof. Iwan-Michelangelo D’Aprile](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/kulturen-der-aufklaerung/personal/prof-dr-iwan-michelangelo-daprile) (University of Potsdam).

My primary research interest is modern European intellectual history, with a focus on French and German thought during the "long nineteenth century". I have published several articles in journals and conference proceedings on topics including Rousseau, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and the methodology of intellectual history. Currently, I am preparing my [doctoral dissertation](https://theses.fr/s385749) on the fates and ideas of German "Bonapartists" during the Napoleonic era.

On this website, you can also find my Chinese translation of Thomas Nipperdey's *Deutsche Geschichte*. A foundational text in modern German history, its importance is matched only by Hans-Ulrich Wehler’s *Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte*. I began this personal project a year ago and continue to update it periodically. It is shared [here](/nipperdey/) for the benefit of interested readers and researchers.
